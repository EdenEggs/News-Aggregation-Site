# News-Aggregation-Site
utilization of gpt3 model partnered with newscatcher api 


### Salutations!
The aim of this little side project is to create a tool and accompanying website that condenses down a wide range of news articles and sites.
The general approach will be to use NewsCatcherApi (https://newscatcherapi.com/) for the gathering of raw information in tandem with the gpt3 model (in charge of summarization magic).
In doing so we hope to arrive at a tangible instrument that helps to **broaden** and **deepen** one's understanding of anything+everything news.

We will aim to make the site as easily _digestible_ and _beginner friendly_ as possible with the allowance of a slider responsible for the density in which the user can view desired categories.

We hope you can find as much use in it as we do!
